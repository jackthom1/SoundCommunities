        <h2 class="whatwedo--header">We run an expanding programme of radio and music production workshops,
            early intervention sessions, employability programmes, broadcasts,
            consultancy and evaluation.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="whatwedo--important">We create platforms and opportunities for people to step up and speak out</h2>
        <p>
            We bring people together in workshops, at community events, on air, and online to share their
            music and opinions. We know how to reach into communities to engage and consult with people
            on the margins to create positive change. Our approach uses radio and music together to
            inspire confidence, raise aspirations, develop creativity and increase skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            We develop bespoke radio packages including early intervention programmes, "pop-up" broadcasts,
            project-based learning, work-based learning opportunities, consultancy and evaluation.
            <strong>We are pioneering in our use of digital technologies.</strong>
